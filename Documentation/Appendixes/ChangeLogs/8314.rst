`BUGFIX: Prevent multiple imports of the same remote asset in the frontend <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/5117>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a frontend fix for `#5116 <https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/issues/5116>`_and prevents users from triggering multiple import processes for the same remote asset. It is not a sufficient fix to only prevent this in the frontend though, since it doesn't catch it, if two or more different users trigger the import for the same asset at the same time.

Changes:
- ``select.js``: add data attribute ``data-import-in-process`` to asset once import process has started and remove it when import is done
- ``select.js``: check for new data attribute and only start import process if attribute does not exist
- ``select.js``: add notification to inform user that asset is being imported
- ``select.js``: add notification as warning for user if import is already in process
- ``Main.xlf``: add new notification messages for english
- ``Default.html``: add id for notification container to be able to send notifications to it via js
- ``Configuration.js``: update ``hasConfiguration`` after configuration object was created, because otherwise it will always be false and the translations don't work

**Info for testing:**
You need to bundle the Neos.Neos assets to get the text for the notification messages.
- navigate to the Neos.Neos package
- run ``yarn``
- run ``yarn build``
